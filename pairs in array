//basic logic i have applied is like simple two loops one starting from intial value and other same as the first loop if we make second loop start from 0 the pairs will be dubplicated like (a,b) and other (b,a)
//which i dont want so i started seond loop from same index as first loop abd stored there values in a variable later displayed it. it still can be improved  later...
